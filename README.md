# OhJournal

## About

This is a personal pet project for fun, learning, and my own use.

It was an open-source replacement for the wonderful [OhLife](http://ohlife.com/) online diary/journal service.

Now it's going to be similar, but also a little bit different.

My aim is to keep it simple, minimalistic, and able to be easily installed on commodity (shared) web hosting.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Update to PHP 8
- [ ] Fix code formatting
- [ ] Convert to using MySQL via PDO
- [ ] Write a nice installation guide (with photos)
- [ ] Convert to MVC layout

## Getting Started

* PHP 8 with PDO
* PHP 8 Cli or CGI
* MySQL or compatible database
* Apache HTTP Server
* Linux with cron
* cPanel (although this is not strictly necessary)
* Ability to send and receive emails

### Installation

1. Todo ...
